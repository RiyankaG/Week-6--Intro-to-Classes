This artwork is titled “Democracy” and by artists Varvara and Mar is in the Abello Museum in Barcelona. It features shows of cats that seem to be holding a baton and hailing a leader, mirroring the Nazi era salute. The cats are programmed to start swinging their batons in the air if audience members say the word “democracy,” in either English, Catalan or Spanish, into a nearby megaphone. The artists aimed to question if they truly were living in a democratic Europe, especially in a time when it seems that “right wing power is gaining radicalization in the world and super rich think that money can bend over laws.” The audience component of this installation drew me in and I find the juxtaposition of the batons waving at the word “democracy” as especially interesting. At first, I didn’t agree that the word democracy should be associated with Nazi-esque hailing with the audience as the Fuhrer. But as I noticed how the hands were moving I noticed they weren’t in unison. Each hand was moving at it’s own rhythm and pace and I then understood the installation as showing the importance of civil unrest when fueled by free thinking.

This is an absolutely amazing piece. As people speak, butterflies start to emerge on the wall, in random patterns, colors and from. The goal is to symbolize the magic of making a wish, with symbolizing the butterfly as carrying that wish away to a person that will either catch the buttefly or the person that the butterfly will land on, either way making the wish come true. I was drawn to this piece simply because of how beautiful I found that idea. It evokes such emotion and as a lover of Spoken Word performances, I believe adding this piece to powerful spoken pieces would truly be magical. Additionally, I think there is beautiful symbolism with a butterfly. My mind went immediately to the butterfly effect and the poetic concept of all our actions leading to consequences and actions that effect someone else, and ultimately affect everyone. Often the concept is used in chaos theory, but I found it especially compelling to use the butterfly and the words of those in the installation as the vehicle for wishes to be shared.
